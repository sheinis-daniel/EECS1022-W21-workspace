	 * Hints:
	 *  - Compare character values using the relational operator ==.
	 *  - Study the 9 test cases in TestUtilites: they are arranged in a systematic (yet not exhaustive) way.
	 *    Q. In order to exhaustively test this game, considering how two players may play in two rounds,
	 *    	 how many tests do we need? (Optionally, you may write extra test yourself as an exercise.)
	 *    
	 * Refer to you lab instructions for what the method should return.
